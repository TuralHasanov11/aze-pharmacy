WPIs are costly to use, but rate among the best proteins that money can buy. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the first ingredient you read on the Gold Standard 100% Whey\u2122 label. By using WPI as the primary ingredient along with premium ultra-filtered whey protein concentrate (WPC), we\u2019re able to pack 24 grams of protein into every serving to support your muscle building needs after training. ON\u2019attention to detail also extends to mixability. This superior quality powder has been instantized to mix easliy using a shaker cup or just a glass and spoon.
